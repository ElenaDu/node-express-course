1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

Middleware in an Express application is a function that has access to the request, response, and the next middleware function
in the request-response cycle. Middleware can perform additional actions, such as logging, authentication, data parsing, error handling. 
Middleware functions are executed sequentially in the order they are defined, and they can either terminate the request-response cycle
by sending a response or pass control to the next middleware function by calling the 'next' function.

2. What does CRUD stand for?
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
These are the four main operations for creating and managing data in relational and non-relational databases.

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
   1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
   In my application, I use a package called 'dotenv' to access the variables from the .env file.
   This package reads the .env file and makes variables accessible throughout my whole application.
   I can access them using process.env.VARIABLE_NAME, where VARIABLE_NAME is the name of the global variable declared in the .env file.


   2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?

   To protect the contents of the .env file and prevent it from being stored in the GitHub repository, I add the .env file to the .gitignore file.
   This ensures that the .env file is not included when I push changes to GitHub.
